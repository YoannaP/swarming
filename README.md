## Report Abstract 

Immersing an asymmetric rotor in an active system sets it into spontaneous rotation.
This report aims to investigate the factors affecting rotation in an active bath. Firstly,
we focus on phase transitions in the Vicsek model in order to understand the physics
of active systems. Throughout the results, a potentially novel phase transition is
observed for the topological Vicsek model. Secondly, the rotors are placed in different
active baths and their rotations are investigated. An empirical relationship is found
between order in the system and rotation, emphasising that collective motion enhances
rotation. Finally, the shapes of the rotors are optimised using a genetic algorithm for
the different bath
